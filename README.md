## How does it work?

1. User joins a Discord server that has the NFT bot, gets an Ethereum address (`.address` to verify)
2. The user uploads files with `.mint` as the comment (jpg, png, gif, mp3, mp4, webm, glb, VRM, WBN)
3. The file uploads to IPFS, Webaverse runs its own pinning server.
4. The IPFS hash is used as the asset URI when minting the token onto the Webaverse sidechain

After minting, the preview server generates a screenshot of 3d models, animated webm for avatars, and playing card version of the token that's viewable on the [dashboard](https://webaverse.com).
